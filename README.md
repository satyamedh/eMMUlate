# eMMUlate
#### Or nDEStruction
#### Or nCryptor

This is an unpatchable exploit to extract the BootROM keys which allows for firebird emulation. It uses the MMU to trick the CPU, hence the name, eMMUlate.

## Read my blogpost [here](https://satyamedh.me/emmulate/) for a full technical explaination!

## How to use?
1. Use [polydumper](https://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_voir.php?id=3829&play=0) to obtain a keyless bootrom dump
2. Copy the bootrom file(btrom.tns) onto your phone or any device that can scan a QR
3. Transfer the .tns from the releases here and run it
4. Scan the QR and inject the bootrom
5. Use with firebird and enjoy!
